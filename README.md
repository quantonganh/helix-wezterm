## Installation

You can simply download [helix wezterm.sh](./helix-wezterm.sh) and [helix-fzf.sh](./helix-fzf.sh) to `~/.local/bin` and then add this directory to your `$PATH`.

### Install via homebrew

```
$ brew install quantonganh/tap/helix-wezterm
```

### Install via [bpkg](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg)

```sh
$ bpkg install quantonganh/helix-wezterm -g
```

## Usage

Ensure that you're using [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) with the [fish_title](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/fish_title.html) [function](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/share/functions/fish_title.fish). This will allow you to see `hx` in the pane title when listing panes:

```sh
  {
    "window_id": 0,
    "tab_id": 167,
    "pane_id": 350,
    "workspace": "default",
    "size": {
      "rows": 48,
      "cols": 175,
      "pixel_width": 2975,
      "pixel_height": 1776,
      "dpi": 144
    },
    "title": "hx . ~/C/p/helix-wezterm",
